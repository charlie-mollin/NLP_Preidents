### Next Steps
*When a task is completed please **STRIKETHROUGH** the bullet point* 

##### GIT
- ~~Set up repo~~
- ~~Eventually create personal branches~~

##### DATA
- ~~Define by party era: Is this done by looping through the folder with the different eras? Investigate this folder!~~

##### ANALYSIS
- ~~Rework pre_proc function to make it more simple, and try to understand it better~~
###### PRIORITY: 
- Update scoring mechanism 
- Word embeddings (I downloaded GlOve, kind of) 
- Why isn't Spacy working? We should lemmatize

###### LOWER PRIORITY: 
- Expand on, refine, Topic Modeling
- Use different clustering techniques, UMAP, OPTICS (could be interesting) — reference [link]([url](https://github.com/wilkens-teaching/info3350-f23/blob/main/lectures/lec-06-clustering.ipynb))
- Discrimination @Matt
- Proper noun implementation? — @Matt
- Later on: sentiment (idr how to do this), etc, visualizations over time of change by sentiment topic (etc)

##### COOL
- Radar charts
- Speech generator, I'll find the Kaggle notebook that did this. Or finetune some smaller — lightweight — model like LLama or BERT
- Zero shot using FLAN-T5 Large could predict dem/republican using pretrained model
