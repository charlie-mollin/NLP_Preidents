# Presidential Speech Sentiment Analysis per Analyzed Party Change

Our overall research and analysis has centered around political speeches and party change in the context of the United States, namely through the president — and if necessary, other sources. Effectively, we have been looking to investigate party change over time, as evidenced by language used in these speeches by different presidents — during different time frames — in dissimilar parties. Having done an in-depth literature review, we found that there does not exist direct studies in analyzing these speeches in the context of party change, showing a gap that we hope to fill in some respect. 

To address this gap we will use various NLP and programming methods — such as LDA, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, scaling, etc — to effectively note nature of speeches and predict their party lean given our corpus and relevant analysis. By comparing party lean of speeches to actual party of the president, we expect to be able to find and show the change of different party rhetoric and ideas over time. By finding this we essentially fill the gap of research into political speeches and party change in this esoteric area. 

Additionally, our work is important as it is direct research into policy and idea changes that affects the day-to-day of all Americans. Given our two party system, most Americans are largely affected by the policies and policy changes vested in these speeches. We expect our work, if successful, to contribute to the political science community, as it furthers research in the area of party change and evolution in the United States. We can do this work as we have the necessary skills in programming and NLP to complete this analysis and find significant results.
